# Array-Processing

This repository contains two C programs, "main.c" and "leTwo.c," that demonstrate array processing with the count of even numbers. The "populateArray" function dynamically allocates an array based on user input and populates it with integers. The "processArray" function processes the array, incrementing even numbers by 1, and counts the total number of even elements. The "main.c" file uses these functions to demonstrate the array processing with even count functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the programs, ensure that you have a C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.

### Compilation

Use the following command to compile the programs:

```bash
gcc -o main main.c
gcc -o leTwo leTwo.c
```

## Usage

1. **Populate Array:**

   The "leTwo.c" program allows you to populate an array with integers based on user input. It dynamically allocates memory for the array and takes the size and elements as input.

2. **Process Array and Count Even Numbers:**

   The "leTwo.c" program processes the populated array and increments even numbers by 1. It then prints the original and updated arrays. The program also counts the total number of even elements and displays the count.
